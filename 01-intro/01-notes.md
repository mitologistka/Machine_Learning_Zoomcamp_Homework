### What is machine learning?
The concept of ML can be illustrated by predicting the price of a car.  An ML model learns from information about objects, called **features** (such as year, mileage), to predict the **target** (in this case, the carâ€™s price).

### What is CRISP-DM?

**CRISP-DM** (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely used methodology for structuring data science and machine learning projects.  
It provides a clear, iterative framework that helps teams move from understanding a business problem to deploying a working solution.  

The process is divided into six main phases:

1. **Business Understanding** â€“ define the objectives, requirements, and success criteria from a business perspective.  
2. **Data Understanding** â€“ collect initial data, explore it, and identify quality issues or insights.  
3. **Data Preparation** â€“ clean, transform, and organize the data into a suitable format for modeling.  
4. **Modeling** â€“ apply different machine learning algorithms, adjust parameters, and build predictive models.  
5. **Evaluation** â€“ assess the models against business objectives and performance metrics to ensure they solve the right problem.  
6. **Deployment** â€“ deliver the results into production (e.g., reports, dashboards, APIs, or integrated ML systems).  

CRISP-DM is **iterative**, meaning you often cycle back to earlier steps as new insights are discovered.

### Some useful basic Git commands

- `git status` â€“ shows the current state of the working directory and staging area. It lets you see which changes are staged, unstaged, or untracked.  
- `git add <file>` â€“ adds changes in a file to the staging area, preparing them to be committed. Use `git add .` to stage all changes.  
- `git commit -m "message"` â€“ records the staged changes in the repository with a descriptive commit message.
