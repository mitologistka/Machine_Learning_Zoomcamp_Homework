# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Progress

I started a **Machine Learning course** created by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).  
The course started on **September 15th, 2025**, and this repository will serve as a place to track my progress in both notes and code.  

More information about the course can be found here:

## 01 - intro 
This chapter provides a brief overview of machine learning, including:

- **What it is**: Machine learning enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions.  
- **How it works**: Using algorithms to train models on data, evaluate performance, and make decisions.  
- **Methodology**: Introduction to **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining).  
- **Types of supervised learning**: Regression and classification.  
- **Tools**: Basic introduction to **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Linear Algebra** concepts essential for ML.
