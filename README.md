# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Progress

I started a **Machine Learning course** created by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).  
The course started on **September 15th, 2025**, and this repository will serve as a place to track my progress in both notes and code.  

More information about the course can be found here:

## 01 - intro

### 🗒 What is machine learning?
The concept of ML can be illustrated by predicting the price of a car.  An ML model learns from information about objects, called **features** (such as year, mileage), to predict the **target** (in this case, the car’s price).
